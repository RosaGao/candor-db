While viewing person B's profile, person A must make a binary decision -- swipe right to indicate liking B or swipe left to indicate disliking. 

A and B match and may start a conversation if and only if they swipe right on each other. 
Additionally, if A swipes left on B before B sees A's profile, A will never show up in B's feed. 

Candor uses an Elo rating system to evaluate the popularity of a user. The underlying premise is that people with similar levels of attractiveness will be most likely to swipe right on each other. Candor exposes a user's profile to a higher proportion of people with a similar elo rating, theoretically increasing their chances of matching.

1. If user A swipes left on user B before the B sees A's profile, A blocks B. Create a VIEW called Blocks that lists the user who blocks, the user who is blocked, and the timestemp of this blocking event. 

2. Elo rating is defined by a simple formula: E = 
Create a VIEW called EloRating that lists the user and his or her elo rating. 

3. List the names of all users who are heterosexual and have swiped right more often on those who are homosexsual than those who are heterosexual. 

4. List the name of users who have more than average view duration by others but have less than average like-to-dislike ratio. 

5. List the name and gender of users who cannot be matched with anyone they like. (i.e. swiped left by everyone they swipe right on)

6. Among the users who have been swiped left by at least one person that they like and has a lower Elo rating, list the name and age of those those who are bisexual.  

7. List the names, ages, city, and country of all pairs of matched users that are in the same city and country. 

8. List the name and gender of all users who, on a single day, have more than 80% chance to swipe right on profiles they view for less than 5 seconds.
